Crust
1  1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (8 ounces)
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
Pinch of kosher salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
Filling
8 large egg yolks
Two 14-ounce cans sweetened condensed milk
1  1/4 cups fresh Key lime juice
Pinch of kosher salt
Unsweetened whipped cream, for serving
Key lime slices, for garnish (optional)
Instructions
Make the Crust
Preheat the oven to 350°. In a medium bowl, whisk the graham cracker crumbs with the brown sugar and salt. Add the melted butter and stir until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Press the crumbs evenly over the bottom and up the side of a 10-inch metal pie plate to form the crust. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes, until just set. Let cool completely.

Make the Filling
In a bowl, whisk egg yolks with the condensed milk, lime juice and salt until smooth. Pour the filling into the cooled crust and transfer to the oven. Immediately lower the oven temperature to 325°. Bake the pie for 20 to 25 minutes, until set around the edge and slightly jiggly in the center. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until firm, at least 6 hours or overnight.

Mound the whipped cream decoratively on the pie and garnish with Key lime slices. Cut into wedges and serve, passing additional unsweetened whipped cream at the table.

MAKE AHEAD The key lime pie can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.
