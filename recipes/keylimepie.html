<h1>Key Lime Pie</h1>
<img src="recipes/img2.jpg" width="600" height="300">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I’ve searched long and hard for the perfect Key lime pie recipe, and finally found one while filming in Florida from a fireman. The ratios are spot on and the custard turns out perfectly every time. Make this recipe with lemons, Meyer lemons, grapefruits, sour oranges… any citrus that is super tart.</p>    
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 Cups Graham Cracker Crumbs (8ozs)</li>
    <li>1/4 Cup packed Light Brown Sugar </li>
    <li>Pinch of kosher salt</li>
    <li>6 Tblsp unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>8 Lg Egg yolks</li>
    <li>2 14-oz cans sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <li>1 1/4 Cups fresh Key Lime Juice</li>
    <li>Unsweetened whipped cream, for serving</li>
    <li>Key Lime slices, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°. In a medium bowl, whisk the graham cracker crumbs with the brown sugar and salt. Add the melted butter and stir until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Press the crumbs evenly over the bottom and up the side of a 10-inch metal pie plate to form the crust. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes, until just set. Let cool completely.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, whisk egg yolks with the condensed milk, lime juice and salt until smooth. Pour the filling into the cooled crust and transfer to the oven. Immediately lower the oven temperature to 325°. Bake the pie for 20 to 25 minutes, until set around the edge and slightly jiggly in the center. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until firm, at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>Mound the whipped cream decoratively on the pie and garnish with Key lime slices. Cut into wedges and serve, passing additional unsweetened whipped cream at the table.</li>
    <li>MAKE AHEAD  The key lime pie can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.</li></ol>
