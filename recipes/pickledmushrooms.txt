1 tablespoon black peppercorns
4 large garlic cloves
4 thyme sprigs
2 dill sprigs
2 bay leaves
1 fresh hot red chile
3 whole cloves
2 cups water
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1 pound mixed chanterelle and morel mushrooms, cleaned with a damp cloth
Instructions
Wrap the peppercorns, garlic, thyme, dill, bay leaves, chile and cloves in a large piece of cheesecloth and tie it with kitchen string.

In a large saucepan, combine the water with the vinegar, sugar, salt and herb sachet and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the mushrooms and return to a boil, then simmer over moderate heat for 1 minute. Transfer the mushrooms and brine to a heatproof bowl and let cool completely, then cover and refrigerate overnight. Drain the mushrooms before serving.

MAKE AHEAD  The pickled mushrooms can be refrigerated in the brine for up to 1 week.
