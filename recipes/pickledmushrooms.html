<h1>Pickled Mushrooms</h1>
<img src="recipes/img1.jpg" width="600" height="300"> 
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Marinovannye Griby are pickled mushrooms in Russian, and until I spent time in St. Petersburg a few years ago, I never would have told you to pickle chanterelles and morels, but I’m telling you…do it. These days, with access to farmers markets and foragers these mushrooms are more prevalent than ever. When I’m confronted with the last few pounds of the season, sometimes a little beat up and half the price they were 3 weeks ago, I’ll pickle them. And this quick pickle is perfect for enjoying all summer long. You can put them up if you are comfy canning, or instead simply keep in fridge for a few weeks. And yes, I make this dish with cremini, button, and any other mushrooms I can find, except the delicate trumpets and Japanese mushrooms.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 Tblsp Black Peppercorns</li>
<li>4 lg Garlic Cloves</li>
<li>4 Thyme Sprigs</li>
<li>2 Dill Sprigs</li>
<li>2 Bay Leaves</li>
<li>1 Fresh Hot Red Chile</li>
<li>3 Whole Cloves</li>
<li>2 Cups Water</li>
<li>1 Cup + 2 Tblsp Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Wrap the peppercorns, garlic, thyme, dill, bay leaves, chile and cloves in a large piece of cheesecloth and tie it with kitchen string.</li>
<li>In a large saucepan, combine the water with the vinegar, sugar, salt and herb sachet and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the mushrooms and return to a boil, then simmer over moderate heat for 1 minute. Transfer the mushrooms and brine to a heatproof bowl and let cool completely, then cover and refrigerate overnight. Drain the mushrooms before serving.</li>
<li>MAKE AHEAD  The pickled mushrooms can be refrigerated in the brine for up to 1 week.</li>
